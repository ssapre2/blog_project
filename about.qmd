Hello everyone! 
My name is Sameer Sapre and I am a data analyst with the Seattle Mariners and a graduate student at the University of Washington studying Industrial Engineering.
I graduated from Penn State University in 2020 with a B.S. in Data Sciences and have previously worked for Mars, Inc.
Outside of work, I'm the President of my [local Toastmasters chapter (please join!)](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/01417617-01417617) and a youth soccer coach with Seattle Parks and Rec.
