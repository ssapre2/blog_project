Hello everyone! My name is Sameer Sapre and I am an analyst working in the Baseball Projects group with the Seattle Mariners.

I am also currently a graduate student at the University of Washington studying Industrial Engineering. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing new sports, hiking, and cooking with friends.

Outside of work and school I am a volunteer usher with Seattle Thetre Group and am the VP of Public Relationships for my local Toastmaster's chapter.
