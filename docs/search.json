    "text": "Feature Engineering\nOur goal is to be able to predict the outcome of each. To do that, we need to think about what impacts the outcome of a game before teams even take the field.\nIn the case of an NFL game it could things like player skill level, how far a team has to travel, injuries, even the food that players ate the night before. Using nflreadr we can see that there are tons of features we could see impacting the game such as …..\nFirst, let’s start with what I think could have the biggest impact on … team strength!\nThere are several ways to quantify team strength, some more complex then others, but for this quick tutorial, we will use recent results as a measure of team strength. The results will be in the form of Cumulative points scored/allowed and winning percentage leading up to the game.\nThen, we’ll create some features…\nFirst, cumulative points.\n\nteam_games %&gt;%\n  arrange(week) %&gt;%\n  group_by(season,team) %&gt;%\n  mutate(cum_score_mean = cummean(team_score),\n          cum_score_opp = cummean(opp_score),\n          cum_wins = cumsum(team_score &gt; opp_score),\n          cum_losses = cumsum(team_score &lt; opp_score),\n          cum_ties = cumsum(team_score == opp_score),\n         cum_win_pct = cum_wins / (cum_wins + cum_losses),\n         cum_win_pct_lag_1 = lag(cum_win_pct,1),\n         cum_score_lag_1 = lag(cum_score_mean,1),\n         cum_opp_lag_1 = lag(cum_score_opp,1)\n         ) %&gt;%\n  # Non-lag variables leak info\n  select(week,game_id,contains('lag_1')) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() -&gt; cum_avgs\n\nWin percentage.\n\nteam_games %&gt;%\n  group_by(season,team) %&gt;%\n  summarise(wins = sum(team_score &gt; opp_score),\n            losses = sum(team_score &lt; opp_score),\n            ties = sum(team_score == opp_score))%&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  arrange(season) %&gt;%\n  group_by(team) %&gt;%\n  mutate(win_pct = wins / (wins + losses),\n         lag1_win_pct = lag(win_pct,1)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() -&gt; team_win_pct\n\nThis should be a good start, but I still feel like something is missing. If I’m trying to predict who will win the game, I want to see the injury report. I want to know who’s actually in the game. Thankfully nflreadr provides that info.\nFirst, we load in depth charts and injury info because we want to know who will be injured, but also if they play an important role on their team. While it would be helpful to know which Niners RBs are out, it would probably helpful know if it’s CMc or not.\n\ndc = load_depth_charts(seq(2011,2021))\ninjuries = load_injuries(seq(2011,2021))\n\n\ninjuries %&gt;%\n  filter(report_status == \"Out\") -&gt; out_inj\n\ndc %&gt;% \n  filter(depth_team == 1) -&gt; starters\n\nstarters %&gt;%\n  select(-c(last_name,first_name,position,full_name)) %&gt;%\n  inner_join(out_inj, by = c('season','club_code' = 'team','gsis_id','game_type','week')) -&gt; injured_starters\n\n# Number of injuries by position\ninjured_starters %&gt;%\n  group_by(season,club_code,week,position) %&gt;%\n  summarise(starters_injured = n()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = position, names_prefix = \"injured_\",values_from = starters_injured) -&gt; injuries_position\n\nhead(injuries_position)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 19\n  season club_code  week injured_S injured_LB injured_RB injured_T injured_C\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1   2011 ARI           7         1         NA         NA        NA        NA\n2   2011 ARI           8         1         NA         NA        NA        NA\n3   2011 ARI           9        NA          1          1        NA        NA\n4   2011 ARI          10         1          1         NA        NA        NA\n5   2011 ARI          11         1          1         NA        NA        NA\n6   2011 ARI          12         1          1         NA        NA        NA\n# ℹ 11 more variables: injured_DT &lt;int&gt;, injured_WR &lt;int&gt;, injured_CB &lt;int&gt;,\n#   injured_G &lt;int&gt;, injured_K &lt;int&gt;, injured_TE &lt;int&gt;, injured_QB &lt;int&gt;,\n#   injured_DE &lt;int&gt;, injured_LS &lt;int&gt;, injured_P &lt;int&gt;, injured_FB &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nAlright, now we have some flags for injured starter at each position.
