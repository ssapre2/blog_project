In the previous post, we went over the basics of `tidymodels` and `nflreadr`. We made a simple game prediction model and with the NFL season underway, let's see if we can't check how our model does at predicting the games played so far.

```{r cars}
# Load prepared data from last post
matchups24 = read.csv('matchups24.csv')

# Load parsnip fit
model1 = load('"C:/Users/samee/OneDrive/Documents/gamePred_model2024.rda"')
```
