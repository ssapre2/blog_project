## Intro

Hello everyone! Today I want to share a quick tutorial on using `nflreadR` to build a simple game outcome model.

First, a quick introduction of `nflreadR` - it's part of the `nflverse` family of packages in R that all easily and efficiently obtaining data from NFL games. In this post, we'll be using its suite of functions to get the data we need to build a predictive model.

First, let's load in some important packages. We'll load in the `tidyverse` for data cleaning and manipulation. The `caret` and `lme4` packages for our model-building.

```{r}
# install and load packages
#install.packages("nflreadr")
library('nflreadr')
library('lme4')
library('caret')
library("tidyverse")
library('pROC')

```

## Load Data

Now that we have the relevant packages loaded, let's get started getting our data together. Starting with game data, we'll pull game results from 2011 - 2021

```{r}
# Scrape schedule Results
load_schedules(seasons = seq(2011,2021)) -> nfl_game_results
```
